## Dionysus

In Greek mythology, Apollo and Dionysus are both sons of [Zeus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeus). Apollo, son of Leto, is the god of the sun, art, music, poetry, plague and disease, of [rational thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_thinking) and order, and appeals to [logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic), [prudence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prudence) and purity and stands for [reason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason). Dionysus, son of Semele, is the god of [wine, dance and pleasure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party), of [irrationality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrationality) and [chaos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_(cosmogony)), representing [passion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passion_(emotion)), [emotions and instincts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentimentality). The [ancient Greeks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece) did not consider the two gods to be opposites or rivals, although they were often entwined by nature.



**“**he glimpsed the supernatural reality through the Ghost; he has gained true knowledge and knows that no action of his has the power to change this. For the audience of such drama, this tragedy allows them to sense what Nietzsche called the *Primordial Unity*, which revives Dionysian nature. He describes primordial unity as the increase of strength, the experience of fullness and plenitude bestowed by [frenzy](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/frenzy#Noun). Frenzy acts as intoxication and is crucial for the [physiological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology) condition that enables the creation of any art.[*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*] Stimulated by this state, a person's artistic will is enhanced:

> In this state one enriches everything out of one's own fullness: whatever one sees, whatever wills is seen swelled, taut, strong, overloaded with strength. A man in this state transforms things until they mirror his power—until they are reflections of his perfection. This having to transform into perfection is—art.**”**
